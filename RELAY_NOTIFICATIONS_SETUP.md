## üîÑ Optional: Creating the Relay Health Check Workflow

If you don't have a "Relay Health Check" workflow yet, create `.github/workflows/relay-health-check.yml`:

```yaml
name: Relay Health Check

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'  # Run every 5 minutes
  workflow_dispatch:       # Allow manual triggering

jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: üîç Check Relay Health
        run: |
          HEALTH_URL="${{ secrets.RELAY_HEALTH_URL }}"
          
          if [ -z "$HEALTH_URL" ]; then
            echo "‚ùå RELAY_HEALTH_URL secret not configured"
            exit 1
          fi
          
          echo "üîç Checking health endpoint: $HEALTH_URL"
          
          # Perform health check
          RESPONSE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$HEALTH_URL" || echo "000")
          
          if [ "$RESPONSE" = "200" ]; then
            echo "‚úÖ Health check passed (HTTP $RESPONSE)"
          else
            echo "‚ùå Health check failed (HTTP $RESPONSE)"
            exit 1
          fi
```

## üöÄ Testing the Setup

1. Add all required secrets to your repository
2. Trigger the Relay Health Check workflow manually (if it exists)
3. Or wait for the scheduled runs to execute
4. Check your Slack/Discord channels for notifications
